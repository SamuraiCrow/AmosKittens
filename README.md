About
-----
Simple AMOS interpreter.

This program is only uploaded to GITHUB, so developers who is interested in helping out can have look at it.
This program is of no use to AMOS developers at the moment, but hopefully it will be in X months time.

Current status:
---------------
This commands are supported.
Dim,Print,Input,Goto
And some math operations works.

Error handling is kind of missing atm, 
also program does not clean up after it self..
