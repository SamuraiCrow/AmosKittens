A small document describing how some commands works different under Amos Kittens. If you like to write programs for Amos Kittens, get the Amos Pro manual, most of the commands are the same and should work the same, only the commands that are different are listed here. not implmented commands not listed, dummy commands not listed, see other docs like issue for more info.


**K2**

  Return mouse button 2, if pressed its true, if not pressed its false.
  in Amos Kittens it works as documneted.
  (this command is buggy in AMOSPRO, its inverted, this way this command is listed)
  
**SX**

  New commmand only in Amos Kittens, not found in Amos Pro.
  Return Screen Width that the bob is on, there is command in the Amos Pro interface lanuage with same name,
  (it returns the width of the current context).
  Do not confuse this with the XS command.
  
**SY**

  New commmand only in Amos Kittens, not found in Amos Pro.
  Return Screen Height that the bob is on, there is command in the Amos Pro interface lanuage with same name,
  (it returns the height of the current context).
  Do not confuse this with the YS command.
  
 **AUtotest**
 
 Autotest in Amos Kittens is granties to run every time.
 
 (in AmosPro the autotest is not run the first time, 
 it does not say so in the manual, so its a bug in AmosPro)
  
 **On**

  The command that should reenable main amal program from autotest after a Wait command.
  works in AmosKittens, (but I think is broken in Amos Pro, failed my testes.)
