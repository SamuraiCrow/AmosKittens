This result of trying to run different .amos files, on Amos Kittens, there is stuff missing, the list is to keep track of problems with etch .amos program, so we can fix problems we have.

**Amal_Editor.AMOS**
(c) 1990-1992 Europress Software Ltd

(works maybe, takes lot time to start in debug mode, it does not work in AmosPRO some programing error some where.)

**Amal_Editor_Fixed.AMOS**
(c) 1990 Mandarin / Jawx

It does load, but does not render correct, after running the program, AmigaOS starts crashingâ€¦

**Disc_Manager.AMOS**

Missing token 0x258C - command "@apml@"
+Synyax error on line 1677
if I'm not mistaken this token means part of program is compiled, so can't support that.

**Font8x8_Editor.AMOS**

Works it starts "AMOSPro_Producitivity2:Font8x8_editor.amos"

**IFF_Compactor.AMOS**

Works it starts "AMOSPro_Producitivity2:IFF_Compactor.AMOS"

**Menu_Editor.AMOS**

Works it starts "AMOSPro_Producitivity1:Menu_editor.amos"

**Object_Editor.AMOS**

ERROR: Address error
At line number: 1184

**Resource_Bank_Maker.AMOS**

Interface: is rendered with wrong colors.
Error at line 1497, when pressing a button.

**Sample_Bank_Maker.AMOS**

 Crashes as soon as you try to load a sample, maybe something wrong on the stack.
 The Amos program does use some 680x0 routines, I have no idea if they are compatible, or not.
